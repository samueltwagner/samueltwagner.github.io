    <p>
    <h3>Hello there! I was raised in Charleston, South Carolina. I've had an affinity for computers, video games, and technology ever since I was a kid. In High School, I took an engineering class that fascinated me. I realized that everything from electricy to robots to programming revolves around 1's and 0's! That connection really blew my mind.
    </h3>
    <h3>I'm now furthing my understanding by majoring in Computer Information Technology with a particular interest in Software Development.</h3>
    <h3>Over the summer of 2017, I was a full-time intern using C#, bootstrap, jQuery, SQL, and the Asp.net MVC framework to build an eforms (electronicForms) platform that helped the company save paper, money, and time.</h3>
